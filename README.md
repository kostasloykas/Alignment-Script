# Alignment-Script

The alignment script is designed to assist testers in managing regression releases by ensuring that data is properly aligned across different releases. For example, when we have regression tests for Release 0.1 in both Release 0.6 and Release 0.7, the script helps verify if the data in each test case within the regression folders is consistent. It also identifies potential errors that may have been introduced accidentally by testers (detailed in the "How the script works" section). This tool enhances productivity by processing hundreds of tests in seconds, ensuring accuracy and consistency more efficiently than manual methods.
